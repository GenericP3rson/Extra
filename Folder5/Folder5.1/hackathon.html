        <!--May I ask what we are doing?
        What do you mean? 
        Tossing around ideas for the hackathon? Yes/no? You were saying?
        Now I'm confused.
        Oh, we're asking questions? Yes? I'm sorry, I'm a little forgetful.
        Wait, so what are we doing? Right! Yes! I remember!
        I've come up with a lot of ideas for things to do.... mostly for the Thanksgiving holiday but we can expand on them?
        That's terrifying. Me too!
        I had a moment of panic as the Thanksgiving holiday is less than 550000 seconds longer and there's so much I wish to accomplish!
        The indentation is annoying. So, what's the topics? 
    -->
        <ul>
            <li>Machine Learning in general</li> 
            <!--That's scary. I don't want to think about my net worth. I just want to go to college.
            I got in a rant today on how I wanted high school to be over and just go to college. 
            You're wanting to go to Oxford, right? He works at MIT now? 
            How many continents have you been to? All but Antarcica. You've been to Europe? 
            Would you be offended if I were to say that that's my least favorite continent? 
            It's too formal for me. Like, everyone goes to Europe. It's so stereotypical. And boring.
            Africa. You've got the most to learn from Africa. Yeah. Oops. We got really off topic.                        
            -->
            <li>Create a "net worth" calculator for students based on grades, things like that.</li>
            <!--I found a list of things to do and since we don't have a net worth really yet I thought it would make
                sense for it to be based on grades. I want middle school to be over and just go to college too. I've heard
                it's amazing. Well, I don't know for sure since Tim Berners-Lee left. I think so. Though I don't really want
                to go to an American college; I want to experience other parts of the world. Two, you? Yes. Yes! Why?!
                ? So what is your favorite continent? Would you like to go back to brainstorming?-->
            
            <li>Email combiner - I don't know about you, but I really only look at my personal email on the weekends.
                <br>
                It sends one giant email with all the emails you got during the week. Perhaps; most likely in order for it to work. Yeah.
                <br>
                I can't relate: I only have one email. But that makes sense. Are you thinking a Chrome Extension?  Nodemailer?
            </li>
            <li>Conway's Game of Life with different rules or apply to different things</li>
            <!--What's Conway's Game of Life? Can I google it?
                It basically is "is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player
                game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input."
                AKA it's like evolution.
                I'll look more into it. It seems fascinating. 
                You mean like identifying someone's handwriting? 
                Oh. What's number recognition? What do you mean by that?
                So like neural networks? Like what 3B1B did plus the segmentation problem?
                Ooh, do you know the machine learning algorithm they use for face recognition? It doesn't use neural nets and it's so cool.
                Yeah. I'm pretty sure I've already excitingly said this to you? How it works and everything?
                Well... I explained it to a Sarah, so it might've not been you?
                You're my priority Sarah? They're back-up Sarahs?
                Anyways, the algorithms pretty much (1) to find the face (to check if the face is present), just looks for the change in, like darkeness
                and whatnot to be able to find, like, eyes or ears or whatever. It's really cool. Dr. Pound explained it in a video that I'll send to you later
                . Then, for facial recognition (which use a form of neural nets, actually), instead of doing the standard neural net thing
                of choosing between like Sarah or Shreya for the faces, they actually chart our faces as some sort of value in a multi-dimensional space.
                It's really, really, really, really, really cool. Dr. Pound did a video on that as well. I think I'm watching a lot of 
                Dr. Pound's videos. He's fantastic. For mine, you've sort of hit on everything by saying "machine learning in general."
                Okay, so, on a slightly different path, have you completed your gradient descent thing?
                On tensorflow, there is an option for gradient descent, but there are also a bunch more different ways to do it.
                My mind got very blown. Which do you think is the best? I don't remember.
                Okay, I'm sort of jumping all over the place. Here's the video for face recognition:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwTaISbA87A.
                And here's the video for detecting faces:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEJ71VlUmMQ.
                                                
            -->
            <li>Going a little deeper: Hand recognition!!!! Number recognition!!!!!</li> <!--This is pretty much impossible, but still...
            Like, identifying their movements. Like, recognizing numbers. Given a picture or a number and finding the number. Yeah.
            Really???? As I mentioned before, I'm kind of a forgetful person. Ah, I see. Woah. That's really cool!                                            
												I've run out of ideas. Yeah, just doing machine learning is already pretty hard to accomplish; going in a certain direction past that would
                                                Be considered a miracle for me. Not yet. Yeah. Well, what types of ways are there?
                                            	Okay, so, for the hackathon, let's go machine learning. Yes/no?
												Yikes. Let's do it!!!!!!! Though what should we do?
            This spacing it very annoying. Can we go back to sarah.js?
